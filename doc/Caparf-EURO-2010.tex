\section{Motivation}
\subsection{}

\begin{frame}{Algorithm development challenges/issues}
\Large
\begin{itemize}
	\item Algorithm details are often omitted in articles \bigskip
  \item It's hard to get/generate test instances proposed by other authors \bigskip
  \item Different system configurations for testing \bigskip
  \item Small number of review articles with algorithms comparisons \bigskip
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Desired solution}
\begin{block}{Consists of}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Algorithms (i.e. lower bounds/upper bounds/exact methods) for solving particular type(s) of problems
	\item Test data generators
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\begin{block}{Provides}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Convenient «testing scenario» model
	\item Various reports generators (for example, results for article in TeX or presentation)
	\item Easy way to develop your own algorithms using existing methods and compare them with well-known reference algorithms by other authors
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\section{Implementation}
\subsection{}

\begin{frame}{Cutting and Packing Algorithms Research Framework}
\Large
\begin{enumerate}
	\item CAPARF is an OpenSource project\\ {\normalsize \itshape hosted at  \textcolor{blue}{http://code.google.com }under GPLv3 licence}
	\item CAPARF is a cross-platform framework\\ {\normalsize \itshape it is implemented in Java}
	\item CAPARF forces unification\\ {\normalsize \itshape all algorithms for the same type of problem implement the same interface}
	\item CAPARF potentially can contain a lot of algorithms and test
data/generators
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Problem type concept}
Problem type is defined by {\ttfamily Input} and {\ttfamily Output}.
\begin{block}{{\ttfamily Input} is represented by}
\begin{itemize}
  \item ordered list of items to pack
  \item and, possibly, ordered list of containers into which items are packed
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\begin{block}{{\ttfamily Output} is represented by}
\begin{itemize}
  \item ordered list of item placements
  \item objective function
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
{\ttfamily OutputVerifier} is implemented for each problem type, i.e. {\ttfamily Input} and {\ttfamily Output}.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Algorithm concept}
Algorithm can be defined for particular problem type or for some class of problem types. \\\medskip
\begin{block}{Algorithm types}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Lower bounds
	\item Upper bounds
	\item Exact methods
\end{enumerate}
\end{block} \medskip
Interruption of algorithm computations can be safely done by implementing {\ttfamily Interruptible} interface.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Test data generator and scenario concepts}
Test data generator provides reference and random {\ttfamily Input}s.\\
Scenario is defined for particular problem type.
\begin{block}{Scenario components}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Algorithms of the same type to run
	\item Test data on which algorithms should be run
	\item Technical constraints (like time limit)
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
Report generator(s) can be added to produce statistics/results in preferable format.
\end{frame}

\section{Contribution}
\subsection{}

\begin{frame}{Contribution}
CAPARF can be successful and useful only as a community project.\\
\begin{block}{Possible types of contribution}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Ideas, suggestions, criticism
	\item Feature requests, bug reports
	\item Code changes, including but not limited to: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Adding your algorithms, test generators
	\item Changing CAPARF core, adding more functionality
\end{enumerate}
